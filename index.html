            <p>I wanted to write an article about elegance initially, and the way I use it to feel good about myself. But upon deeper reflection, I realized that elegance is essentially just a fashion choice and the point I am trying to make is that fashion can change your perception of yourself and influence your mood.</p>

One of the answers was “self-esteem, confidence, positive mindset”. Now, I’m no stranger to these concepts - for many years, these were recurring themes...</p>

            <p>No matter where you live around the globe, there is still a lot of stigma around the concept of going to therapy. Even in the most modern and progressive cultures, some people still strongly believe that mental health issues are not real, or that it’s only the bat shit crazy that should seek therapy.

            <p>I don’t know about you, but if I wake up to pee in the middle of the night, the chances are I will not be able to get back to sleep. When I sleep, my mind turns into a vortex where dozens of thoughts spin simultaneously - both positive things and anxiety inducing things. If I become aware for a few minutes, the thought I might land upon when gaining consciousness might be soothing - which helps me return to a sweet comforting sleep afterwards. Or it might just be the latest anxiety inducing thought or thing that makes me angry - and in that case, my brain is like “hell no, you’re not going back to sleep. You’re awake now and I’ll give you enough energy to ruminate for hours about a stupid illogical thing”.</p>
