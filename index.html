            <p>I don‚Äôt know about you, but if I wake up to pee in the middle of the night, the chances are I will not be able to get back to sleep. When I sleep, my mind turns into a vortex where dozens of thoughts spin simultaneously - both positive things and anxiety inducing things. If I become aware for a few minutes, the thought I might land upon when gaining consciousness might be soothing - which helps me return to a sweet comforting sleep afterwards. Or it might just be the latest anxiety inducing thought or thing that makes me angry - and in that case, my brain is like ‚Äúhell no, you‚Äôre not going back to sleep. You‚Äôre awake now and I‚Äôll give you enough energy to ruminate for hours about a stupid illogical thing‚Äù.</p>
