<p>Miss Tincu is a writer, creative goddess and video editor.</p>
<p>Her passion for writing was born as a means of escaping the reality of living in challenging home conditions as a child.</p>
<p>The adversity she faced during childhood includes, but is not limited to: the death of her mother from breast cancer at the age of five; poverty; having an alcoholic Hulk-like step-mother for ten years and an alcoholic, depressed, mentally absent Goofy-like father (he’s still going strong); exposure to violence, poor treatment and psychological abuse.</p>
<p>She took refuge in reading, writing and learning at an early age, and quickly became a star pupil. Despite what was going on at home, she soldiered through and developed a quality needed for survival: resilience. After going strong academically for many years, the unaddressed trauma started to catch up with her and everything came crumbling down. Before her end-of-highschool exams, she entered a severe depression that made her go from star pupil to bottom of the class and, ironically, failing the end-of-highschool Psychology exam.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the same year, she enrolled in Journalism in EN at Babes-Bolyai University, then dropped out after a year due to money issues and the undiagnosed depression and severe anxiety that she carried with her from highschool. After moving to Worthing, England,  she was able to obtain a government grant and enroll, and later graduate from, a BA in Creative Media Practice: Journalism & Video Production, awarded by the University of Brighton.</p>
<p>Professionally, she wore many hats over the years: from Content Writer & Editor in Chief (RO), to Housekeeper (UK), Receptionist (UK), Camera Woman & Video Producer (UK), Video Editor (RO), Pin-up model (UK) and Social Media Specialist (RO).</p>
<p>After having an off and on relationship with blogging for over 10 years, she is now ready to commit.</p>
<p>She currently lives in Cluj-Napoca with her boyfriend of 5 years, in a rented apartment that came with ugly furniture. Her day job is Team Leader at a Marketing Start-up. She dreams about adopting a dog one day and showering it with love.</p>
<p>Her hobbies include: eating, finding comedy in tragedy, baking, crying, petting ANY dog, gossip, helping and empowering others, watching trash TV, working on her pin-up aesthetic and making funny Youtube videos.</p>
<p>The purpose of this blog is to help others feel less alone. Here you will find articles about Mental Health, Work Culture and Work Ethics, Creative Struggles, Womanhood and more.</p>
<p>Miss Tincu’s motto is “Started from the bottom and I’m still there”.</p>
<p>She is a firm believer that talent, potential, hard work and perseverance are not enough – you also need connections and a fair share of good luck to succeed. She is also convinced that the bottom has many layers which she will continue to explore indefinitely on this blog.</p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>
